-Weird Facts Generator-

This the the Weird Facts Generator. It is a website that has a bunch of weird, interesting facts from different categories such as math, english, science, history, and art. I created this website because i have always been facinated with the weird things in this world and I like learning about random facts. I wanted to make a website that I would enjoy using. I worked on this project for about 2 weeks using Visual Studio Code. the 3 main laguages I used were javascript, html, and css. I put all the facts into a google doc. There are about 50 different facts in each category. All the facts in this website were researched by me and I tried to make sure that all the facts came from credible sources, had multiple websites about them, and were not out-dated. If I found a fact from a blog or a sort of unreliable source I would reasearch it to see if it was actually true and try to find at least 3 different sources that support it. If there are any facts that are outdated or incorrect I will try to make it right.

I am pretty new to coding so this was a really big and challenging project for me. I didn't know how to make the buttons or how to add a quiz but there were a lot of online resources to help me. For example, the W3School website(https://www.w3schools.com/) help me a lot and I also watch a bunch of coding youtube videos. I learned a lot about event listeners and how to add buttons to a website. Althought this was pretty challenging, this was really fun and I learned a lot- about coding and about the world.
